The original design for the nose, before I turned it into an actual enclosure, is from **Stefan Potrovic** (a.k.a. [monochroma380](https://sketchfab.com/monochroma380)) and can be found on [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/nose-model-3-f9a65e76ae52415591d63a51666194d5). A huge thanks to him for the original work, and for allowing me to publish the derivative work.
